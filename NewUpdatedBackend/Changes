Changes were made as per the new code.

To be done:
1. Need to check the values some of them are not in the correct range(Logical errors might be the reason)
2. Set parameters of some classes were working but some changes need to be made for the front end to make them effective.
3. Human body class should have some makor changes regarding the reading of the values and work of TICKs part.

These are the target for the next week
